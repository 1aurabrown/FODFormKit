To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Project directory first.

## Requirements

FODFormKit currently requires iOS7. It mostly works on iOS6 with cosmetic issues, but I don't have a need for this currently so I'm unlikely to fix them myself. Pull requests with iOS6 fixes are welcome, though.

## Installation

FODFormKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "FODFormKit"
